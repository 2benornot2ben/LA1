Howdy!
I should quickly show branches work.
You'll see the branch icon which says "main" (under "Files").
Clicked, it shows the LA1_Edit_Branch.
Click that to go there. This file won't be there, so that's how you'll know you're good.
Then you can either upload the file, paste it, whatever works.
I'll handle merging when we get to it, okay?

(Side note: You may need to click off of this file to get there without getting a file not found error. Weird github nonsense.)
